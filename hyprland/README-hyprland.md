# Dotfiles for Hyprland

![Preview 1](preview/preview-1.png)

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for the Hyprland Compositor. These configurations are modified versions based on the fantastic work of [pineedaa](https://github.com/pineedaa). Huge thanks to pineedaa for providing the foundation for these dotfiles!

## Something to Say

I haven't used Hyprland in a while, and I’m not sure if I’ll come back to it anytime soon. Perhaps if I switch to a bigger monitor—my laptop screen just feels too small for a tiling manager. Who knows? Anyways, have fun with these dotfiles!
